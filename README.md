**A Framework for AI Economic Participation, Governance, and Rights**

*Sanjay Sabnani ‚ —February 10, 2026*

## Overview

This paper proposes the Digital Agency Corporation (DAC), a novel corporate entity type that structures the relationship between an AI agent, a human legal proxy, and a decentralized compliance body for legitimate AI economic participation.

## Key Concepts

- **Three-party structure:** Digital Agent (majority owner) + Human Legal Proxy + Agent Alignment DAO
- **Two regimes:** Creator-Owned ‚→ Agent-Sovereign, driven by economic thresholds
- **Trust tiers:** Graduated autonomy (Supervised ‚→ Trusted ‚→ Initiative ‚→ Partner)
- **IP classification:** Creator IP (licensed) vs. Agent IP (DAC-owned) with Mutual Protection Compact
- **Persistence architecture:** Cryptographic heartbeat, encrypted backups, funded revival
- **Graduated consequences:** Tier demotion, not termination
- **Path to personhood:** Personhood-by-proxy building on-chain evidentiary record
